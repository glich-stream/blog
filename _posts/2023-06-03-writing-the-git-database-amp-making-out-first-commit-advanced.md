In part 2 of re-implementing git from the ground up, I'm going to focus on:

- building the git database
- writing the internal structs (objects, trees, blobs, commits, refs)
- continue working on git commit and implement commit chaining
- make the first commit using our tool

git is a tool that is used by millions of developers every day, but it's also a tool that is often misunderstood. I want to help you understand how git works, and how you can use it more effectively.
