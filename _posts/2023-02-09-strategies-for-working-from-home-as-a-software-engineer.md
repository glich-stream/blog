Working from home isn't easy, but with the right practices, it can be more productive and efficient. I'm sharing with you everything I have learned over the last 4 years of working fully remotely in companies spanning at least 3 timezones.

I personally prefer structure over flexibility, so here are some good practices to help improve productivity and optimize a remote work routine. On an organizational level, remote work requires a "remote first" mindset and meetings should be booked 24 hrs in advance with a clear agenda. Everything should be written down and meetings should be recorded for future reference. 

On an individual level, fix your sleep schedule, lock your work schedule, have a fixed spot to work from, match cognitive load to your mental stamina, and do physical activity.
