Interviewing can be a challenging process, and companies do not always make it easy. The opportunities available to you can vary greatly depending on market conditions, demand for software engineers, and the capabilities of tech recruiters, among many other factors.

In this episode, I interview Alla Pavlova, a tech and art talent recruiter at Riot Games. We discuss the interview process from start to finish, including building job descriptions and negotiating salaries. We also delve into hiring company expectations and tactics that candidates can use to find opportunities in other countries. If you're starting your career, looking to relocate, or seeking a new opportunity, you won't want to miss this episode!
