A toxic work environment is a workplace where employees feel uncomfortable, unsupported, or even threatened. This type of environment is marked by significant drama and ongoing conflict, and can have serious negative effects on an employee's mental and physical health, as well as on their overall job performance. Some common signs of a toxic work environment include bullying, harassment, discrimination, favoritism, and a lack of support from management.
