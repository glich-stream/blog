A super casual live stream where I'll continue building gh-stars, a new GitHub CLI extension. If you missed the previous parts, it's OK, I always start with an introduction.

I'm not a Go expert, so I'm doing this side project to learn and explore the language. This is a great opportunity for you to learn more about data structures, Go, building CLI tools, linux, unit testing, and general programming principles!

This stream is not rehearsed or planned. Don't expect a polished session, the outcome could be 3 lines of code at the end of the 2 hours or more, who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÑ 

Drop by and say hello!
