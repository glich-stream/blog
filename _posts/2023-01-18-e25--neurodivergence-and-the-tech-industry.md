Neurodiversity refers to the variance of neurological differences, behaviours and brain functions within the human population. The concept of neurodiversity has become controversial, with some individuals and groups advocating for acceptance and accommodations while others criticise it. 

In my chat with Shea we debunked the stereotypes and explored the impact that autism has on his career as a software engineer and CTO at his startup Mentra. 

I learned a lot from Shea as I‚Äôm sure you will too!
