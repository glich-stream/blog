If you want to keep enjoying programming, don't make it your job. I have been writing code professionally for about 16 years now, and the excitement of programming has been fading away over time. When I first started, everything I did was exciting. The challenge, the learning, the growth, and the feeling of building something that will be used by many others were all wonderful. However, these feelings eventually become normal and are no longer as intense.

This is not advice to change anything, but rather a warning. Despite this, I would do everything the same way if I had the chance to live my life again. However, if you have the option to make a living in some other way and keep programming as a hobby, do it. These amazing feelings will last longer this way.
