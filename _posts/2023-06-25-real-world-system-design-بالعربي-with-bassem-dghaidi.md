This video covers the essentials of system design. I'll explain how to define the requirements and goals of your system, document the discovery process, and understand the motivations and constraints behind your design decisions. I'll also discuss estimations, scheduling constraints, and managing uncertainty, as well as technical implementation. I'll share tips for effective diagramming and discuss challenges specific to SaaS and traditional companies. This is a comprehensive overview of system design best practices!
