A super casual live stream where I'll continue building gh-stars, a new GitHub CLI extension. I'm not a Go expert, so I'm doing this side project to learn and explore the language. This will be a great opportunity for you to tap in and get a feel for the stack.

This stream is not rehearsed or planned. Don't expect a polished session, the outcome could be 3 lines of code at the end of the 2 hours or more, who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÑ 

Tune in to say hello or to hang out.
