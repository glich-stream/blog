I'm attending GitHub Universe this year and one of the coolest perks is having access to the programmable Pimoroni Badger 2350. This video is a walkthrough of the process of running a simple implementation of the game of life on the badge. 

In the video, I made a mistake and talked about the RP2040 but in fact, this badge came with the RP2350. These 2 have different specs and slightly different capabilities, but everything else in the video should apply just the same.
