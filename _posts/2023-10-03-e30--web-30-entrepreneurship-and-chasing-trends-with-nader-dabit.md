Nader is a fascinating character! He's a software engineer, entrepreneur, and a creator currently building in a space that once was one of the most hyped segments of the tech industry. I wanted to chat with Nader to unpack and challenge his thoughts and ideas about Web 3.0, more specifically the blockchain, cryptocurrencies and social networking protocols.
