How does software engineering in Europe or the USA defer from the work we do in the Middle East and North Africa region? What are some of the biggest challenges preventing the Middle East and North Africa from becoming technology hubs? What‚Äôs the caliber of the talent available in the region? Can it compete internationally?

I discussed these questions and more with Ahmad Alfy, CTO of Robusta Studio, who we all respect and love. I could spend hours chatting with Ahmad, and I hope you enjoy this episode as much as I did producing it.
