We're rewriting git in Go. Yes, really. In this live stream series, I'm going to be re-implementing git from the ground up so that you can get the chance to understand at a very deep level how this tool works.

git is a tool that is used by millions of developers every day, but it's also a tool that is often misunderstood. I want to help you understand how git works, and how you can use it more effectively.

In this part, I covered:
- deep dive into the .git folder
- understanding objects, trees, blobs, and their representation on disk
- scaffolding the CLI and implementing git init, git commit
