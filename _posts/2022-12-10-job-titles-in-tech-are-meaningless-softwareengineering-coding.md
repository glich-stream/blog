Job titles in tech are often meaningless and can be misleading. For example, you might ask for a promotion but only receive a new title without a pay bump. Job titles in tech are not regulated or standardized, so they can mean different things between different companies, even within the same industry. It is common to see senior software engineers with only three years of experience and Chief Technical Officers who manage teams of one.

While job title hierarchies can be a useful way to visualize a career path, it is important to focus on growing your skills, experience, and impact, rather than the titles you have been given. These titles will mean nothing when you interview for a job at another company.
