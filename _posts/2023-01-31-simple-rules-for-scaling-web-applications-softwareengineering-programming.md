If you‚Äôre still confused about how you can scale your web application, remember these 3 things:

1. Fill the bucket
2. Replicate
3. Distribute

Fill the bucket means adding more resources (cpu, RAM, disk space) to your application. When your service‚Äôs performance stops improving with more resources, move on to

Replicate, which is basically creating a copy of your service and changing your architecture so that you can handle incoming state mutations from different sources.

Finally, distribute! This basically means splitting your monolith backend into smaller services and distributing your logic amongst them.

DO NOT SKIP steps. Even if you think you‚Äôre ready technically, you team and org as a whole might not be ready financially or operationally for the impact! Consider carefully your constraints when tackling scale problems. Remember, solve for the present and near future, not for problems you ‚Äúthink will come‚Äù in the far future
