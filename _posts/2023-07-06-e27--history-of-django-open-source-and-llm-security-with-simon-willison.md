Simon Willison is the creator of Datasette, an open source tool for exploring and publishing data. Prior to becoming an independent open source developer, Simon was an engineering director at Eventbrite.

He is a co-creator of the Django Web Framework, and has been blogging about web development and programming since 2002.

In this episode, we explored the history of Django, we discussed the challenges of maintaining and monetising popular open source projects, and the security problems of large language models.
